##Opinion of the Instructional Assignment

My initial response to the first assignment was a good one. I believe an instructional paper is an easier off the bat assignment, and it allows an oppurtunity to experience GitHub for the first time. I also felt like my topic of choice gave me a real reason to do well on the assignment. I love bird hunting and training our dogs, so doing an instructional piece on bird dog training had some added value. I already knew everything about it, so it gave me the freedom to actaully write about something I had an interest in, and not just a randomely assigned topic. For that reason, I believe my instructions worked very well, because I cared about them and wanted to do a good job explaining the art of training bird dogs using homing pigeons. 

I though the assignment parameters were fair. 1000 word goal is not too hard to achieve, and it gives plenty of oppurtunity to explain something. I did have a lot of trouble uploading a picture for the document, so I eventually decided not to use one. My paper could have benefited from a visual aid for certain aspects of the tools used for the procedure, but a picture was not extremely necessary for a well executed instrcutional document. 

For the future I would continue to allow for a choice of topic, and freedom of orgainization. I really liked how we were allowed for our own layout of the paper. This freedom allowed creativity and uniqueness among the class.
